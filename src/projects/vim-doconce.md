title: Doconce for vim
---

The [first book] I ever read on programming was called *A Primer on Scientific
Programming with Python* by Petter Langtangen. I noticed in the Preface that
the book was written using [DocOnce]. I was familiar with $\LaTeX$ but had
never heard of DocOnce. I got interested in the project and ended up using it
quite extensively to write quizzes while I was teaching chemistry classes.

I found in the documentation for DocOnce that there is an emacs package which
includes syntax highlighting, but I was not able to find anything similar for
vim. So I wrote my first vim plugin ([vim-doconce]). It is amazing how much
easier it is to write and read code with syntax highlighting.
