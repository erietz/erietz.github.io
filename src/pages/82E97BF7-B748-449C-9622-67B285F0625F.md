## Three Rules

1. Do not expose her to light.
2. Do not get her wet.
3. Do NOT feed her after midnight!

## Food

- She eats about $\frac{1}{2} \text{cup}$ of dog food total per day.
    - The scoop size in the dog food bag is $\frac{1}{4} \text{cup}$.
    - She eats three times per day.
    - So fill the scoop about $\frac{2}{3}$ full each time.
    - $3 \times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{2}{3} = 3 \times \frac{2}{12} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}$ ðŸ˜Š
- She also drinks water ($H_2O$) out of her bowl.

## Daily Routine

- We usually get her out of her long term confinement area (LTCA) around 7am.
    - Make sure she pees in her litter box before leaving or she will pee
    (probably on a bathroom mat).
    - Play with her for awhile
    - She likes when you roll balls
- When you have to go to work put her back in the bedroom with the door closed
    - She does not need locked in the LTCA.
    - She can play around in the room.
    - Make sure to open the blinds so she has some light.
- If you get the chance repeat play time at lunch.
    - If its nice out I usually take her to the dog park to play.
        - Put her purple harness on and the leash on to get her to the dog park.
        - She will put up a fight putting the harness on so you kind of have to
        chase her down and give her treats.
        - If there are no other dogs in the park dogs you can take the leash
        off.
- She should go back into the bedroom with the door closed after lunch if you
leave.
- If you are at home all day she can come out or stay in the room.
    - Your choice depending on level of annoyance.
- We usually take her out and leave her out after 5pm.
- We put her back in the LTCA (locked up) around 10-10:30pm for bed.
    - Make sure the blinds are closed for warmth.

## Other

- Dog treats are in the console table behind the couch
- A bully stick will keep her entertained for a long time
    - She likes the esophagus ones but they are stinky
- The pupperoni and beef sticks are way too big and she will choke so you gotta
cut them up into teacup sizes
- Do not let her eat the plants.
    She likes to mess with them
- If you let her on the couch, watch her closely because she will try to jump
off and break her legs.
