<p>The <a
href="https://hplgit.github.io/primer.html/doc/pub/half/book.pdf">first
book</a> I ever read on programming was called <em>A Primer on
Scientific Programming with Python</em> by Petter Langtangen. I noticed
in the Preface that the book was written using <a
href="https://github.com/doconce/doconce/">DocOnce</a>. I was familiar
with <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> but had never heard of
DocOnce. I got interested in the project and ended up using it quite
extensively to write quizzes while I was teaching chemistry classes.</p>
<p>I found in the documentation for DocOnce that there is an emacs
package which includes syntax highlighting, but I was not able to find
anything similar for vim. So I wrote my first vim plugin (<a
href="https://github.com/erietz/vim-doconce">vim-doconce</a>). It is
amazing how much easier it is to write and read code with syntax
highlighting.</p>
