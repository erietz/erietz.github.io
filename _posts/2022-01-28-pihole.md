## Intro

Last night I installed [pi-hole] on one of my raspberry pies and am quite
pleased with the results. I spent several days reading a about pi-hole and
figured it would be complicated to get configured. In all it took about 10
minutes to get up and running and I wish I would have done it sooner.

## Installation

### Setup Static IP Address

First you need to set up a static IP address for the pi to make thing easier.
The easiest way to do this in my case was to simply login to the router and
change the settings there. On my router settings there was a button called "Add
device with reserved IP" which takes you to a simple form.

### Supported OS

I would have run pi-hole directly on my device, but unfortunately I am running
the [Manjaro Arm] edition on all of my pies. At the time of writing, the
operating systems show below support pi-hole.

| Distribution                        | Release                     | Architecture        |
| ---                                 | ---                         | ---                 |
| Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) | Stretch / Buster / Bullseye | ARM                 |
| Ubuntu                              | 16.x / 18.x / 20.x /21.x    | ARM / x86_64        |
| Debian                              | 9 / 10 /11                  | ARM / x86_64 / i386 |
| Fedora                              | 33 / 34                     | ARM / x86_64        |
| CentOS                              | 7 / 8                       | x86_64              |

Fortunately, this problem is solved with [Docker].

### Docker

The very first link from [pi-hole]'s documentation points to how to run the
software in a docker container. Even though I could now theoretically run
pi-hole from any Linux distro/machine, I chose to continue on the raspberry pi
4 as there is a low energy cost with keeping it running all the time.

I followed the [quick start guide] on GitHub which is well documented. You can
have pi-hole up and running be simply following the next steps!

#### Steps

1. `sudo pacman -Syu docker docker-compose`
2. Paste the following code into a file named `docker-compose.yml`
```yml
version: "3"

# More info at https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/ and https://docs.pi-hole.net/
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "67:67/udp" # Only required if you are using Pi-hole as your DHCP server
      - "80:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/Chicago'
      # WEBPASSWORD: 'set a secure password here or it will be random'
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
      - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
      - './etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'    
    #   https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN # Recommended but not required (DHCP needs NET_ADMIN)      
    restart: unless-stopped
```
3. Change the `WEBPASSWORD` and other settings as necessary
4. Run `docker-compose up -d` to build and start pi-hole
5. Go to the IP address of your pi in your browser (e.g. `192.168.0.foo/admin`)
   to get to the pi hole web UI.
6. Setup your devices with the DNS of your pi.

## Setup DNS on each device

For the time being, I decided that I wanted to manually configure each device
to use pi-hole rather than configuring my entire network through the router's
settings. The main reason being that if the pi goes down for some reason, I can
still connect to the internet by simply reverting the devices settings rather
than messing with the router.

### iPhone

- Go to Settings
- Wi-Fi
- Click the i symbol with circle next to your network
- Configure DNS
- Change from automatic to manual
- Delete any DNS servers that may be there already
- Enter the IP address of you pi

### Desktop Linux

I initially tried changing the DNS settings using Network
Manager through a GUI called "Advanced Network Configuration"
but the settings did not appear to do anything.

What worked for me was to create the file `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dns-servers.conf`
which contains

```
[global-dns-domain-*]
servers=::1,192.168.0.29

```

the arch wiki.
