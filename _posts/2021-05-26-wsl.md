The file permissions on Windows Subsystem for Linux are very screwed up by
default. To fix this...

## Step 1

Create the file `/etc/wsl.conf` if it does not already exist and add the
following:

```conf
[automount]
enabled = true
options = "metadata,umask=22,fmask=11"
```

## Step 2

1. Clone your windows drive to an extra 500GB HDD you have lying around using
   Macrium Reflect.
2. Put the hard drive in a drawer and forget about it.
3. Install Linux on your NVMe
4. Enjoy the simplicity
