    <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>

    <p>
I am a postbaccalaureate student in computer science at Oregon State
University. I have an undergraduate degree biochemistry from Iowa State
University, and I studied for some time as a PhD student in physical chemistry
at Indiana University before deciding to pursue a career in computer science.
For fun, I (rarely) play the drums in a band called <a
href="https://www.thewireframes.com/">The Wire Frames</a> with my older
brother.
