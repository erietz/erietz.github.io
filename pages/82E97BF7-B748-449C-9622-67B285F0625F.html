<h2 id="three-rules">Three Rules</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do not expose her to light.</li>
<li>Do not get her wet.</li>
<li>Do NOT feed her after midnight!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<ul>
<li>She eats about <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}
\text{cup}\)</span> of dog food total per day.
<ul>
<li>The scoop size in the dog food bag is <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4} \text{cup}\)</span>.</li>
<li>She eats three times per day.</li>
<li>So fill the scoop about <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span> full each time.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(3 \times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{2}{3}
= 3 \times \frac{2}{12} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}\)</span> ðŸ˜Š</li>
</ul></li>
<li>She also drinks water (<span class="math inline">\(H_2O\)</span>)
out of her bowl.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="daily-routine">Daily Routine</h2>
<ul>
<li>We usually get her out of her long term confinement area (LTCA)
around 7am.
<ul>
<li>Make sure she pees in her litter box before leaving or she will pee
(probably on a bathroom mat).</li>
<li>Play with her for awhile</li>
<li>She likes when you roll balls</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you have to go to work put her back in the bedroom with the
door closed
<ul>
<li>She does not need locked in the LTCA.</li>
<li>She can play around in the room.</li>
<li>Make sure to open the blinds so she has some light.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you get the chance repeat play time at lunch.
<ul>
<li>If its nice out I usually take her to the dog park to play.
<ul>
<li>Put her purple harness on and the leash on to get her to the dog
park.</li>
<li>She will put up a fight putting the harness on so you kind of have
to chase her down and give her treats.</li>
<li>If there are no other dogs in the park dogs you can take the leash
off.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>She should go back into the bedroom with the door closed after lunch
if you leave.</li>
<li>If you are at home all day she can come out or stay in the room.
<ul>
<li>Your choice depending on level of annoyance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We usually take her out and leave her out after 5pm.</li>
<li>We put her back in the LTCA (locked up) around 10-10:30pm for bed.
<ul>
<li>Make sure the blinds are closed for warmth.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dog treats are in the console table behind the couch</li>
<li>A bully stick will keep her entertained for a long time
<ul>
<li>She likes the esophagus ones but they are stinky</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The pupperoni and beef sticks are way too big and she will choke so
you gotta cut them up into teacup sizes</li>
<li>Do not let her eat the plants. She likes to mess with them</li>
<li>If you let her on the couch, watch her closely because she will try
to jump off and break her legs.</li>
