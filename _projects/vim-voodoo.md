title: Seaborn syntax highlighting in vim
---

A while ago I got interested in programming color schemes and started a project
called [vim-voodoo]. It is called vim-voodoo since I was originally inspired by
the colors on the voodoo ranger six pack case. However, the scheme that I made
from those colors turned out to not be very readible, especially when
programming during the day. I eventually decided to make color schemes using
the [seaborn] colors and calculate the contrast ratios for each of the colors
compared to the background color.

Of all of the schemes that I made, my favorite goes by the name of "Set3". I
use it every day in neovim and like it so much that the css for this site along
with the `code` highlighting uses the Set3 colors.
