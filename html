<p>I am a postbaccalaureate student in computer science at Oregon State University. I have an undergraduate degree biochemistry from Iowa State University, and I studied for some time as a PhD student in physical chemistry at Indiana University before deciding to pursue a career in computer science. For fun, I (rarely) play the drums in a band called <a href="https://www.thewireframes.com/">The Wire Frames</a> with my older brother.</p>
